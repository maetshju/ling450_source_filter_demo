This notebook is a crude demo of source-filter theory for human speech. It was desigend to accompany the source-filter lecture for "LING 450 - Introduction to Linguistic Phonetics" at the University of Washington. This notebook can be launched using Binder or viewed with NBViewer with the badges below. It can sometimes take a while for the Binder image to load, so please be patient. I have had trouble getting the audio to play on Firefox, so you may need to use Chrome, Edge, Chromium, or similar for the audio to work correctly.
